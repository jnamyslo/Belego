WHY AGPL v3?
================================================================================

The AGPL v3 license ensures that Belego remains free and open source forever,
while protecting against the "SaaS loophole" where companies could host 
modified versions without contributing back to the community.

This creates a healthy ecosystem where:
- Everyone can use and modify the software freely
- Improvements benefit the entire community
- Commercial hosting is allowed and encouraged
- The copyleft protection extends to network use

================================================================================
SAAS HOSTING
================================================================================

You are explicitly permitted and encouraged to offer Belego as a hosted
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). The AGPL v3 license requires that you:

1. Make your complete source code (including any modifications) available
   to your users/customers
2. License your modifications under AGPL v3
3. Provide clear instructions on how users can obtain the source code

This ensures that the open source spirit is maintained even in commercial
hosting scenarios.
